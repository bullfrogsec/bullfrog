# Docker mod
# IMPORTANT: insert rule adds rules at the TOP of the chain
# So we must insert in REVERSE order to get the correct execution order
#
# Desired execution order:
# 1. DNS packets (all, even established) → queue for inspection
# 2. Established/related non-DNS → accept (fast path)
# 3. New connections → queue for decision
# 4. Everything else → drop

# Drop everything else (shouldn't reach here if Go agent is working)
# This will be the LAST rule checked
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER iifname "docker0" counter drop

# Queue new connections (non-DNS) for Go agent decision
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER iifname "docker0" ct state new counter queue num 0

# Accept established/related NON-DNS connections automatically (fast path)
# These come AFTER DNS rules but BEFORE new connection queue
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER oif "docker0" ct state established,related counter accept
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER iifname "docker0" ct state established,related counter accept

# Match DNS packets FIRST - ALL DNS traffic must be queued, even if established
# DNS responses are established connections but we MUST inspect them to learn IPs
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER oif "docker0" tcp sport 53 counter queue num 0
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER oif "docker0" udp sport 53 counter queue num 0
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER iifname "docker0" tcp dport 53 counter queue num 0
insert rule ip filter DOCKER-USER iifname "docker0" udp dport 53 counter queue num 0
